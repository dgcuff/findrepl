# findrepl
Script to perform multiple find-and-replace in files that supports batching; written in Python

- Coming soon: a branch of https://github.com/mehonal/bulk-hypertext-regex-find-and-replace
- History: Mehonal created the Python script as work for hire for me, which meant that I owned it. I ceded copyright to Mehonal, who chose to apply the MIT licence. Therefore this branch is likewise applying the MIT licence.
